requests	2.31.0	Compatible	HTTP library; no direct interaction with Django; safe to use.
cx-Oracle	8.3.0	Not Compatible	Deprecated in Django 5.x; replace with oracledb version 1.3.2 or higher.
django	4.1.2	Not Compatible	Upgrade to Django 5.x.
djangorestframework	3.15.1	Likely Compatible	Check for the latest version compatible with Django 5.x.
django-environ	0.9.0	Likely Compatible	Check for the latest version compatible with Django 5.x.
asgiref	3.5.2	Compatible	Ensure it’s updated to the latest version compatible with Django 5.x.
sqlparse	0.4.2	Compatible	Ensure it’s updated to the latest version compatible with Django 5.x.

Recommendations:
	1.	Upgrade cx-Oracle:
	•	Replace with oracledb version 1.3.2 or higher to ensure compatibility with Django 5.x.
	2.	Upgrade django:
	•	Update to Django 5.x.
	3.	Upgrade djangorestframework and django-environ:
	•	Check for the latest versions of these packages that are compatible with Django 5.x.
	4.	Update Other Dependencies:
	•	Ensure all other dependencies are updated to their latest versions to maintain compatibility and security.

Additional Steps:
	•	Testing: After upgrading, thoroughly test your application to identify and resolve any compatibility issues.


	•	Review Release Notes: Examine the release notes of each dependency for any breaking changes or deprecations that may affect your application.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your application remains stable and secure after upgrading to Django 5.x.
Yes, upgrading these versions (especially Django and related dependencies like djangorestframework, django-environ, and switching from cx-Oracle to oracledb) will likely require some Python code changes in your project. Here’s an outline of potential changes you might need to make:

1. Django-Specific Code Changes

a. Middleware

	•	Django 5.x might deprecate or remove certain middleware features.
	•	Review your MIDDLEWARE settings and replace outdated middleware if required.

b. URL Routing

	•	If your project uses the old django.urls.path or django.urls.re_path APIs, ensure they align with Django 5.x conventions.
	•	Check for deprecated patterns, such as using tuples in urlpatterns.

c. Settings

	•	Review your settings.py file for deprecated keys or features (e.g., old DATABASES configurations).
	•	For example:
	•	Update DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD if your models don’t explicitly set a primary key.

d. Models

	•	Django may introduce changes to default field behavior or deprecate certain field types.
	•	Check for:
	•	Removed or deprecated model field options.
	•	Custom model managers or overridden methods (e.g., save or delete) that depend on deprecated APIs.

e. Forms

	•	Review custom forms for compatibility if using older Django form widgets or APIs.

f. Signals

	•	Some signals may have updated behavior or arguments.

2. Rest Framework (djangorestframework) Changes

If you are upgrading djangorestframework:
	•	Check serializers, views, and permissions for deprecated methods or classes.
	•	For example, older APIView methods like get_serializer_class or get_queryset may require updates.
	•	If you use custom authentication or permissions, ensure they are compatible with the latest DRF APIs.

3. Switching from cx-Oracle to oracledb

	•	Connection Code:
	•	oracledb introduces a slightly different API compared to cx-Oracle. Update all places where the Oracle connection is established.
	•	For example:

import cx_Oracle  # Old
import oracledb   # New


	•	If you used features like connection pooling or specific Oracle data types, they might require minor refactoring.

	•	Database Queries:
	•	Review raw SQL queries if you rely on custom Oracle syntax.
	•	Test for compatibility with the oracledb driver, especially if using Oracle-specific features.

4. Dependency-Specific Code Changes

a. django-environ

	•	Ensure your .env file is compatible with the latest django-environ version.
	•	Check for changes in how environment variables are read or parsed.

b. asgiref

	•	If you use Django’s async features (e.g., async views), review the updated ASGI specifications.

5. Python 3.x-Specific Changes

If you are also upgrading Python to a newer version (e.g., 3.11 or 3.12):
	•	Update syntax for deprecated features (e.g., old-style async or coroutine methods).
	•	Review all third-party libraries to ensure compatibility with the new Python version.

How to Check for Required Code Changes

	1.	Run the Django System Check Framework:

python manage.py check

This will highlight deprecated or incompatible code.

	2.	Use django-upgrade Tool:
Install the django-upgrade tool to automatically update your codebase:

pip install django-upgrade
django-upgrade .


	3.	Run Tests:
	•	Run unit tests and integration tests to identify code issues caused by dependency upgrades.
	4.	Read Release Notes:
	•	Carefully review Django, DRF, and other dependency release notes for breaking changes.

Effort Estimation

The effort required depends on your codebase size and complexity:
	•	Small projects: Minimal changes (10–20 hours for code updates and testing).
	•	Medium projects: Moderate changes (40–60 hours).
	•	Large projects: Extensive changes (80+ hours, especially with custom models, middleware, or database queries).
