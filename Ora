Moving from on-prem Oracle to Azure PostgreSQL instead of Azure Oracle can present several challenges. Here’s why staying with Azure Oracle might be a better choice:

1. Migration Complexity & Effort
	•	Schema Conversion Effort: Oracle and PostgreSQL have significant differences in data types, stored procedures, and indexing. Moving to Azure PostgreSQL requires a complete schema transformation.
	•	PL/SQL to PL/pgSQL Conversion: If your applications rely heavily on Oracle’s PL/SQL, migrating to PostgreSQL requires rewriting stored procedures, packages, and triggers.
	•	High Refactoring Cost: Applications using Oracle-specific features like DBLINK, Materialized Views, Flashback, or Oracle Streams will require major redesign.

2. Performance & Query Optimization Issues
	•	Query Plan Differences: Oracle’s Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO) works differently from PostgreSQL’s query planner, leading to unexpected performance degradation.
	•	Parallel Processing & Partitioning: PostgreSQL lacks some advanced parallel query execution and partitioning features found in Oracle.
	•	Indexing Differences: Oracle supports Bitmap indexes and Reverse key indexes, which PostgreSQL doesn’t handle the same way.

3. Business Continuity & Downtime Risks
	•	Testing & Stability Risks: Moving to PostgreSQL introduces risks of undetected issues in query performance, transaction management, and database behavior.
	•	Longer Migration Timeline: Migrating Oracle to PostgreSQL (instead of Oracle-to-Oracle) requires extensive regression testing, increasing project duration.
	•	Rollback Complexity: If the PostgreSQL migration fails, rolling back to Oracle is difficult due to fundamental database differences.

4. Application & Integration Challenges
	•	Third-Party Application Compatibility: Many enterprise applications (SAP, Oracle E-Business Suite, etc.) are built for Oracle and may not support PostgreSQL without modifications.
	•	Database Links & Replication: Oracle’s DBLINK and Advanced Replication features do not directly map to PostgreSQL’s postgres_fdw.
	•	Security Features: Oracle has advanced security features like Virtual Private Database (VPD), Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), and Label Security, which require alternative solutions in PostgreSQL.

5. Cloud Benefits with Azure Oracle
	•	Minimal Changes: Moving from on-prem Oracle to Azure Oracle is much simpler than migrating to PostgreSQL. You retain all Oracle features, reducing migration effort.
	•	Better Performance & Scalability: Azure Oracle supports high availability, automatic patching, and Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) for better scaling.
	•	Licensing & Support: If your organization already has Oracle licenses and support agreements, staying on Oracle ensures continued vendor support.

Conclusion

If your organization wants a low-risk, fast, and less disruptive migration, staying within the Oracle ecosystem and moving to Azure Oracle is the better choice. Migrating to Azure PostgreSQL requires significant rework, performance tuning, and potential application redesign, making it a high-cost and high-risk move.

Migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL involves several complexities. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Schema Migration Complexity
	•	Data Types Mapping: Oracle and PostgreSQL have different data types (e.g., NUMBER vs. NUMERIC, CLOB vs. TEXT).
	•	Sequences & Auto-increment: Oracle uses SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL, whereas PostgreSQL supports SERIAL, BIGSERIAL, and IDENTITY.
	•	Synonyms and Global Temporary Tables (GTTs): PostgreSQL does not support synonyms directly, and GTTs work differently.

2. Stored Procedures and Functions
	•	PL/SQL vs. PL/pgSQL: Oracle’s PL/SQL has a richer set of built-in features than PostgreSQL’s PL/pgSQL.
	•	Packages: Oracle packages don’t have a direct equivalent in PostgreSQL. Code must be refactored.
	•	Cursors & Loops: Syntax differences in handling cursors and loops require changes.

3. Triggers and Constraints
	•	BEFORE/AFTER Triggers: PostgreSQL supports triggers, but the way they are implemented may differ.
	•	Check Constraints & Foreign Keys: Need to verify support and any behavior differences.

4. Performance Tuning Adjustments
	•	Indexes: Oracle has bitmap indexes, function-based indexes, and reverse key indexes, which may not have direct equivalents in PostgreSQL.
	•	Optimizer Differences: PostgreSQL query planner works differently from Oracle’s Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO).
	•	Parallel Processing: Oracle’s parallel execution features are more advanced than PostgreSQL’s.

5. Replication and High Availability
	•	Oracle Data Guard vs. PostgreSQL Streaming Replication: Different replication architectures require reconfiguration.
	•	Materialized Views: PostgreSQL materialized views don’t auto-refresh like Oracle’s; they require manual refresh.

6. Security & User Management
	•	Role-based Access: PostgreSQL uses roles, but privileges may need reconfiguration.
	•	Virtual Private Database (VPD): PostgreSQL does not have a built-in equivalent for Oracle VPD but can use Row-Level Security (RLS).

7. Application Changes
	•	SQL Query Differences: DECODE() in Oracle vs. CASE WHEN in PostgreSQL, NVL() vs. COALESCE().
	•	Database Links: PostgreSQL requires postgres_fdw to replace Oracle’s DBLINK.
	•	Error Handling: Exception handling syntax and behavior differ.

8. Migration Strategy
	•	ETL Tools: Tools like Ora2Pg, AWS DMS, and native scripts may be required.
	•	Downtime Planning: Migration can involve downtime, requiring a rollback plan.
	•	Testing & Validation: Data consistency, application queries, and performance must be tested post-migration.
