Certainly! An Aggregated Demand Response (ADR) solution in the energy sector is a compelling choice for a problem statement, especially as energy providers are increasingly focused on balancing grid stability, reducing peak demand, and supporting renewable energy integration. Here’s how you might frame the problem statement for this use case:

Problem Statement: Aggregated Demand Response in the Energy Sector

Industry: Energy (Utilities, Smart Grid)

Problem Statement:
“An energy utility provider faces growing challenges in managing peak demand periods and maintaining grid stability, especially as renewable energy sources like solar and wind introduce variability into the energy supply. Currently, the provider lacks a scalable, real-time platform to aggregate and control demand response (DR) from distributed energy resources (DERs), such as smart appliances, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and battery storage systems, across residential and commercial customers. This limitation leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased reliance on fossil-fuel-based peaker plants to meet peak demand.

To address these issues, the utility provider seeks to develop an Aggregated Demand Response (ADR) platform. This cloud-based solution will enable real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of DERs across the grid, allowing for automated responses to demand surges. By aggregating customer-owned energy assets, the ADR platform aims to reduce peak demand, enhance grid flexibility, and support sustainability goals.”
