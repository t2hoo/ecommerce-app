Certainly! An Aggregated Demand Response (ADR) solution in the energy sector is a compelling choice for a problem statement, especially as energy providers are increasingly focused on balancing grid stability, reducing peak demand, and supporting renewable energy integration. Here’s how you might frame the problem statement for this use case:

Problem Statement: Aggregated Demand Response in the Energy Sector

Industry: Energy (Utilities, Smart Grid)

Problem Statement:
“An energy utility provider faces growing challenges in managing peak demand periods and maintaining grid stability, especially as renewable energy sources like solar and wind introduce variability into the energy supply. Currently, the provider lacks a scalable, real-time platform to aggregate and control demand response (DR) from distributed energy resources (DERs), such as smart appliances, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and battery storage systems, across residential and commercial customers. This limitation leads to inefficiencies, higher operational costs, and increased reliance on fossil-fuel-based peaker plants to meet peak demand.

To address these issues, the utility provider seeks to develop an Aggregated Demand Response (ADR) platform. This cloud-based solution will enable real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of DERs across the grid, allowing for automated responses to demand surges. By aggregating customer-owned energy assets, the ADR platform aims to reduce peak demand, enhance grid flexibility, and support sustainability goals.”

Current industry trends require advanced analytics capabilities, which enables the organization to analyze the business, research new methodologies and solve problems resulting in increased value and operation efficiency and excellence.
Business applications, such as and Aggregated Demand Response, support business processes and manage the data generated by these systems. Traditionally, these solutions have lacked robust integrated analytics capabilities.
Traditional end-to-end BI solutions, such as data repository primarily focus on data preparation and integration, as well as analysis via scripting, reporting, and interactive visualizations such as dashboards.
Currently, each one of these data families are stored in a source system. With the implementation of the Data Analytics Platform a copy of this data, including historical lineage of that data family/category if applicable, will be stored in the dap.
