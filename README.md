Business weeds
* Business needs a "real-time" data of the DA, HASP and RT LMP prices for selected CAISO nodes to help making more informed and thus, accurate deals.
* Traders can benefit by timely Price information and thus, adjusting RT schedules.
Traders need a GHG cost calculator so that price for the complete transaction can be calculated quickly.

Other Real-time desks are also interested in the "Real-Time" price data from CAISO.
Traders need a tool that provides the CAISO price information as soon as published on OASIS so as to be able to exploit the CAISO Real-time fluctuation and benefit by either limiting or increasing flow to CAISO and update deals with the external counter parties.

2.2 Overview
* CAISO Price Tool (CPT) is used to continuously monitor the market (RT, HASP and IFM) prices on a dashboard screen
* Depending on the users configured header nodes, users can use the Dashboard for monitoring the prices for those nodes based on which user will make a decision to buy the energy units.
* Any CAISO RT prices publish is updated in a CAISO DB, which is continuously monitored by CPT, thereby refreshing the user dashboard for monitoring.
User has a provision to set the threshold values for each and every node and the corresponding market when a price value for a market reaches the threshold it will alert user by showing the alarm on the screen and playing the alert sound. The Alarm alert and sound will be there in the screen until the user acknowledges all the alarms
